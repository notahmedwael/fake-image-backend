# FastAPI Backend for Fake/Real Image & Video Detection

This is a FastAPI backend using pre-trained ML models (Xception, YOLOv8, LSTM) to detect whether an uploaded image or video is real or fake.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Image & video upload
- YOLOv8-based human detection
- Xception classification
- LSTM for video classification
- CORS enabled
- Contact form logging

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- Railway (or Render, etc.)
- Python 3.10+

## ðŸš€ Deploy on Railway

1. Fork or clone this repo
2. Create a new Railway project
3. Add environment variable:
   - `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` or your own like `MODEL_DOWNLOAD=true`
4. Deploy
